# 2x Company Handbook
---

For years, weâ€™ve ran our business without writing down who we are, what we believed, or how we worked. So whenever someone joins or gets introduced to our company, they had to figure out all out of these things by themselves. As a startup, we often changed our processes. Sometimes, a decision what made sense yesterday, may no longer make sense today. Other times, we forget why a particular process was added or dropped in the first place.

So, the purpose of this handbook is to record our values, our history, and our processes. It's a guide for everyone at the company to understand our business, know what we stand for, how we make decisions, and ultimately, figure out how to be better perform, enjoy our work, and deliver strong results.

## Introduction
---

2x is a growth marketing agency. We help established companies with existing users and revenue increase their profits by:

* Getting more paying customers;
* Getting existing customers to spend more;
* Getting existing customers to buy more often;
* Getting our clients achieve the same revenue with lower costs.

We do this by learning about our client's industry, product and services, users, and competitors. Then using our research, we test marketing campaigns and new designs to see what works. 

We require a few things in order to be successful:

1) Happy former clients to build a strong track record and maintain our reputation
2) Demand from new clients to pay us for our services
3) Talented designers, marketers, developers, and analysts to run experiments and campaigns for our clients.

To accomplish these things, we need the following:

* Human Resources to recruit talented designers, developers and, marketers, keep them happy, and maintain our culture.

* Operations to run our team of designers, marketers, and developers. Make sure campaigns are delivered on time and on budget, and ensure the team is always improving.

* Client Relations to build relationships with our clients, understand and anticipate their needs, and make sure we exceed their expectations.

* Business Development to find great new companies for us to work with and sell them on the value of our services.

* Finance to make sure we keep our costs under control, bill our clients, and track our results.
